## Background

My name is Nathan Jones, and I am a student at Brigham Young University studying Machine Learning. I have a strong interest in using Statistics and Machine Learning techniques to explore, visualize, and find answers in data. I am also passionate about practical use cases for AI systems that can help automate workflows, both in professional and creative settings.

## Education

**Brigham Young University**

- **Bachelor of Science in Machine Learning**  
    - Expected Graduation: April 2027    
- **Relevant Coursework**: 
    - Advanced Machine Learning
    - Deep Learning
    - Data Science Processes
    - Mathematics of Data Science

## Skills & Interests

### Technical Skills
- **Programming**: Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, C  
- **Data Analysis & ML**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, Tableau  

### Areas of Interest
- Human–AI collaboration in creative tools and workflows  
- Reinforcement learning for games and simulations  
- Computer vision and perception-based models  
- Intelligent systems for prediction, decision-making, and automation  

## Goals

Currently, I am working to deepen my understanding of modern machine learning techniques, particularly reinforcement learning and deep learning. My goal is to become more proficient in these areas, and to come up with workflow outlines that can be generally applied when approaching a problem for the first time.

Long-term, I hope to pursue graduate study in machine learning or a related field. Upon graduating, I hope to work for a tech company to help solve large scale real world problems using techniques of data science and machine learning that I've learned in my schooling.
