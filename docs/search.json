My goal is to become more proficient in these areas, and to come up with workflow outlines that can be generally applied when approaching a problem for the first time.\nLong-term, I hope to pursue graduate study in machine learning or a related field. Upon graduating, I hope to work for a tech company to help solve large scale real world problems using techniques of data science and machine learning that I’ve learned in my schooling."
